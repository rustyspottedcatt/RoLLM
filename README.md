# RoLLM: Roblox Language Model

RoLLM (**Roblox Language Model**) is an experimental implementation of a GPT-like Transformer designed to run inside the Roblox Studio environment. While it’s not fully functional for practical use, it serves as an educational project showcasing how to build a Transformer-based language model in Luau.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**RoLLM is currently not suitable for generating meaningful text.** Due to Roblox's performance and memory constraints, large-scale models (like GPT-2 or GPT-3) are not feasible to run fully in-engine. The project is open-sourced to invite collaboration and experimentation—perhaps the community can find ways to make it work or leverage it in creative ways.

## 🚀 Features

- **Tokenization**: Includes both character-based tokenization and a placeholder for subword-based (BPE-like) tokenization.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Implements key components like embedding layers, multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, and layer normalization.
- **OOP Structure**: Clean, modular, and object-oriented Lua code for easy extension and experimentation.
- **Configurable**: Supports customizing model parameters like the number of layers, hidden dimensions, and maximum sequence length.

## ✨ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone or download the project into your Roblox environment.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL.git
   ```

2. **Load the Model**

   In your Roblox script, require the `init.lua` module and pass your configuration.

   ```lua
   local LLM = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.src.lib)

   local config = {
       dModel = 32,
       numHeads = 4,
       dFF = 64,
       numLayers = 2,
       maxSeqLen = 128,
       tokenizerMode = "char",  -- or "bpe"
       externalVocabURL = "https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/raw/main/vocab.json",
   }

   local myLLM = LLM.new({"Hello world! This is a test corpus."}, config)

   local nextChar = myLLM:predict("Hello wor")
   print("Next token:", nextChar)
   ```

3. **Run Simple Tests**

   - **Generate Text:**
     ```lua
     local generated = myLLM:generate("Hello wor", 5)
     print("Generated text:", generated)
     ```
   - **Temperature Sampling:**
     ```lua
     local tempGenerated = myLLM:generateTemperature("Hello wor", 10, 1.0)
     print("Temperature-based generated text:", tempGenerated)
     ```

## ❓ Why Open Source?

While RoLLM demonstrates the structure of a Transformer in Lua, it faces significant challenges when deployed in Roblox:

- **Performance Constraints**: Large matrix multiplications and deep models are slow in Roblox’s sandboxed environment.
- **Memory Usage**: Storing pretrained weights or even running large models can exceed Roblox’s limits.
- **Lack of Pretrained Weights**: RoLLM does not include trained parameters, so outputs are random unless you train or import weights.

This project is open-sourced to:
1. Share insights into how Transformers can be implemented in Lua.
2. Encourage collaboration—perhaps the community can optimize or find creative solutions.

## 🛠️ Possible Improvements

- **External Inference**: Offload heavy computations to an API (e.g., OpenAI or Hugging Face).
- **Efficient Training**: Train a small Transformer offline and import weights into Roblox.
- **Optimized Math**: Use optimized Lua or external libraries for faster matrix operations.
- **Small Models**: Experiment with tiny models (e.g., 1–2 layers, small embedding size) for simple use cases.
